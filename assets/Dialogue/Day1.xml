    <Intro>
        <segment>Hello again {player_name}.</segment>
        <segment>We've procured a fresh test subject for the experiment.</segment>
        <segment>Our task is to give them a sense of self.</segment>
        <segment>To do this, we must give them a goal.</segment>
        <segment>Collecting some branches for a shelter should do the trick.</segment>
        <segment>First, locate the test subject and we'll take it from there.</segment>
        <segment>They should be somewhere on the west side of this island.</segment>
    </Intro>
    <Main1>
        <segment>Perfect.</segment>
        <segment>Now, we have some branches to place for our test subject.</segment>
        <segment>We should try to make it at least a little challenging</segment>
        <segment>and scatter them reasonably well.</segment>
    </Main1>
    <Complete_Slow>
        <segment>Finally done?</segment>
        <segment>We wanted to evoke a sense of purpose, not hopelessness.</segment>
        <segment>If the task is out of reach, then so is the meaning behind it.</segment>
    </Complete_Slow>
    <Complete_Fast>
        <segment>Done already?</segment>
        <segment>We're trying to evoke a sense of purpose here.</segment>
        <segment>There's no meaning to be found in trivial tasks.</segment>
    </Complete_Fast>
    <Outro>
        <segment>So we see, by providing a personal goal for the test subject,</segment>
        <segment>for which their own needs come first, the test subject will become aware of their individuality</segment>
    </Outro>
